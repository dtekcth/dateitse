        <h3>DatE-IT 2020</h3>
        <p> The date for DatE-IT 2020 has been decided, it's going to be on
        Thursday the 19th of November. If you're interested in attending the
        fair you can send in an application of interest at <a
        href="https://app.date-it.se">https://app.date-it.se</a>. By applying
        to the application of interest you'll show us that you're interested in
        attending the fair this year and will be considered as a exhbitor at
        the fair during the selection process (the interest application is not binding in anyway).
        </p>
        <p>
        Becuase of limited spots and high pressure for the fair there's going
        to be a selection process to decide which companies gets to attend. The
        selection process will start in the beginning of summer and be
        finalized in the fall.
        </p>

        <h3>DatE-IT 2019</h3>

        <p>
        The crew of DatE-IT 2019 would like to thank everyone who took part in
        and made DatE-IT 2019 to the amazing fair it was. We took a big risk by
        moving the fair to a new location this year, and it paid off. The new
        location helped us in the crew allow for better planning for future
        fairs aswell as an easier and better placement of companies.

          <h3>General info</h3>
          <p>
          The purpose of DatE-IT is to give an opportunity for your company and

          for your company to get to know the students and let them know what
          you can offer them.
          </p>

          <h3>Speakers Week</h3>
          <p>
          The week prior to DatE-IT is referred to as <i>Speakers Week</i>.
          This is an opportunity for your company to present itself
          during a lunch lecture. The lecture will let the attendants get
          familiarized with your company and is a great way to increase
          the number of students visiting your company's showcase at the
          fair.
          </p>
          <p>
          If your company wishes to take part in Speakers Week, please
          express your interest in the DatE-IT interest application. This
          is not binding!
          </p>

          <h3>Interview rooms</h3>
          <p>
          Private interview rooms may be used by companies wishing to interview
          students during the fair. In addition, this option will let students
          send you their CVs about a week before the fair. If your company gets
          a spot at the fair you'll get the option to decide if you want this.
          However there is a limited amount of spots so make sure to motivate
          why you want it in the final application
          </p>

          <h3>Banquet</h3>
          <p>
          Representatives from companies may take part in our celebratory
          banquet after the fair is over! All packages include banquet tickets
          it and it's also possible to purchase more.

      <div class="col-lg-10 offset-lg-1">
        <h2>For students</h2>
        <h3>Prepare</h3>
        <p>
        Start by going through the catalog and select the
        companies you are interested in. Do it carefully, visit the
        companies websites to understand more what they are working
        on. Decide which companies you should visit during DatE-IT
        and focus on them, it's much better than aimlessly walking
        around among all of the companies.</p>
        <p>
        Are you at the stage of finding a job or thesis project and want the
        company to take an interest in you? Think about how you want to present
        yourself. You can practice at home on a short pitch or write down some
        notes that will help you present yourself in the best way possible. By
        being well-informed and prepared, you can match your skills and
        abilities against the company's. It is not only your education,
        specialization and elective courses that are important. Trust and
        overseas experience is often seen as an advantage. Your personality
        will determine whether you get the job or not. Think about yourself,
        who are you? What do you want? What do you know?</p>

        <h3>Make contact</h3>
        <p>
        The exhibitors at DatE-IT will most probably not give you
        a thesis project or a job immediately. If you make contact
        with the company representer, ask for a business card and
        inform that person that you would like to contact him or her
        again. Make sure to be remembered! You can give the company
        your own business card or your résumé. Keep track of which
        company that have received your résumé. Write down and
        document what has been said and how possible future contact
        will take place.</p>
        <p>
        If you choose to leave your résumé, remember that it is your
        way of marketing yourself. Make sure that the résumé clearly
        states who you are, what you know and also what your goals
        are. Be as thorough as possible when you write your résumé.
        It should be easy for the employer to understand your
        competense. If you contact different companies, you can give
        them different résumés which are tailor-made to each
        company.</p>

        <h3>Submit your résumé</h3>
        <p>
        During the fair it is possible to attend interviews with a number of
        companies. To take advantage of this opportunity, you must submit your
        résumé. More information on how to do this will come later.

        <h3>Become a company host</h3>
        <p>
        In order for DatE-IT to be arranged other than the core crew planning and arranging the fair there is also a need for DatE-IT hosts. A host is just a regular student that helps the core crew with the fair. Hosts are not part of planning the fair but are instead given the responsibility of hanlding communications with an attending company, helping them find their spot in the morning and answering general questions about the fair. Hosts also help set up the fair the day before and some help with the wardbrobe and lounge during the fair.
        </p>
        <p>
        As a thanks for helping with the fair all hosts get breakfast and lunch during the fair day aswell as a free ticket to the banquet.
        </p>

        <p>More information about how to apply as a host will come later.</p>
