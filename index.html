            <h2>About DatE-IT</h2>
            <p>The labour fair DatE-IT is unique since it is directed
            towards Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Information
            Technology. This makes the fair a great opportunity for students
            and companies in these exact fields to meet and network. By
            focusing on companies in only the fields mentioned above we can
            keep the size of the fair just right and thereby having the
            chance to hold it in the EDIT-building. The EDIT-building at
            Chalmers is the daily studying environment for the about 2000
            students with the particular orientations Computer Engineering,
            Electrical Engineering and Information Technology. This means
            that the students will be at their home ground in the meeting
            with companies which creates a relaxed atmosphere.</p>
            <!--<p>
            The DatE-IT 2015 catalogue is available and you can find it here:</p>

                <h3>DatE-IT 2019 interest application</h3>
                <p>DatE-IT 2018 is already filled but you can make an interest application for DatE-IT 2019 already!
                To make sure that your company gets information regarding
                DatE-IT 2019, feel free to fill out the interest application.
                It is in no way binding, it only makes sure that you will be
                contacted from a DatE-IT representative when the fair is drawing
                near.</p>

                <p>

                </p>

                <h3>General info</h3>
                <p>The purpose of DatE-IT is to give an opportunity to introduce
                your company and to network with the 2000 future engineers that
                study Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Information
                Technology at Chalmers.</p>
                <p>
                The fair is of appropriate size. Big enough to attract a large
                amount of students, but at the same time small enough to get to
                know eachother. The fact that the fair is held in the
                EDIT-building - where the students of Computer Engineering,
                Electrical Engineering and Information Technology spend most of
                their days to study - gives the fair a personal touch that is
                hard to achive at other fairs of greater size.</p>

                <p>DatE-IT 2018 will take place on <b>November 15th.</b></p>

        <div class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1">
            <h2>For students</h2>
            <h3>Prepare</h3>
            <p>
            Start by going through the catalog and select the
            companies you are interested in. Do it carefully, visit the
            companies websites to understand more what they are working
            on. Decide which companies you should visit during DatE-IT
            and focus on them, it's much better than aimlessly walking
            around among all of the companies.</p>
            <p>
            Are you at the stage of finding a job or thesis project and
            want the company to take an interest in you? Think about how
            you want to present yourself. Practice at home on a short
            and pithy presentation. By being well-informed and prepared,
            you can match your skills and abilities against the
            company's.
            It is not only your education, specialization and elective
            courses that are important. Trust and overseas experience is
            often seen as an advantage. Your personality will determine
            whether you get the job or not. Think about yourself, who
            are you? What do you want? What do you know?</p>

            <h3>Make contact</h3>
            <p>
            The exhibitors at DatE-IT will most probably not give you
            a thesis project or a job immediately. If you make contact
            with the company representer, ask for a business card and
            inform that person that you would like to contact him or her
            again. Make sure to be remembered! You can give the company
            your own business card or your résumé. Keep track of which
            company that have received your résumé. Write down and
            document what has been said and how possible future contact
            will take place.</p>
            <p>
            If you choose to leave your résumé, remember that it is your
            way of marketing yourself. Make sure that the résumé clearly
            states who you are, what you know and also what your goals
            are. Be as thorough as possible when you write your résumé.
            It should be easy for the employer to understand your
            competense. If you contact different companies, you can give
            them different résumés which are tailor-made to each
            company.</p>

            <h3>Submit your résumé</h3>
            <p>
            During the fair it is possible to attend interviews with a
            number of companies. To take advantage of this opportunity,
            you must submit your résumé.

            <p>Unfortunately resume submissions for DatE-IT 2018 has closed.</p>
                <!--Résumé submission are available <a href="https://podio.com/webforms/15841545/1063344">here</a>.--></p>

            <h3>Become a company host</h3>
            <p>By applying to be a DatE-IT host you will either be given
            the responsibility of handling communication with one of the
            attending companies before the fair day and make sure that
            they have the best possible experience during the fair
            itself, or be involved in the overall fair management and
            organizational work to make sure that everything flows
            smoothly! During the evening you will get the chance to
            mingle and eat dinner with all the attending companies and
            other students.</p>
            <p>
            As a company host you will get: breakfast, lunch, a ticket
            to the banquet, and a DatE-IT T-shirt which you will wear
            during the day. Snacks will be available the whole day
            during the fair.</p>
