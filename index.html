            <h2>About DatE-IT</h2>
            <p>The labour fair DatE-IT is unique since it is directed
                towards Computer Science, Electrical Engineering and Information
                Technology. This makes the fair a great opportunity for students
                and companies in these exact fields to meet and network. By
                focusing on companies in only the fields mentioned above we can
                keep the size of the fair just right and thereby having the
                chance to hold it in the EDIT-building. The EDIT-building at
                Chalmers is the daily studying environment for the about 2000
                students with the particular orientations Computer Science,
                Electrical Engineering and Information Technology. This means
                that the students will be at their home ground in the meeting
                with companies which creates a relaxed atmosphere.</p>
            <p>
                The DatE-IT 2015 catalogue is available and you can find it here:</p>

            <h2>For companies</h2>

            <h3>DatE-IT 2016 interest application</h3>
            <p>To make sure that your company gets information regarding
                DatE-IT 2016, feel free to fill out the interest application.
                It is in no way binding, it only makes sure that you will be
                contacted from a DatE-IT representative when the fair is drawing
                near.</p>

            <p><a href="http://podio.com/webforms/14367750/963063">Interest application</a></p>

            <h3>General info</h3>
            <p>The purpose of DatE-IT is to give an opportunity to introduce
                your company and to network with the 2000 future engineers that
                study Computer Science, Electrical Engineering and Information
                Technology at Chalmers.</p>
            <p>
                The fair is of appropriate size. Big enough to attract a large
                amount of students, but at the same time small enough to get to
                know eachother. The fact that the fair is held in the
                EDIT-building - where the students of Computer Science,
                Electrical Engineering and Information Technology spend most of
                their days to study - gives the fair a personal touch that is
                hard to achive at other fairs of greater size.</p>

<!-- Student Section -->

        <div class="col-lg-10 col-lg-offset-1">
            <h2>For students</h2>
            <h3>Prepare</h3>
            <p>
                Start by going through the catalog and select the
                companies you are interested in. Do it carefully, visit the
                companies websites to understand more what they are working
                on. Decide which companies you should visit during DatE-IT
                and focus on them, it's much better than aimlessly walking
                around among all of the companies.</p>
            <p>
                Are you at the stage of finding a job or thesis project and
                want the company to take an interest in you? Think about how
                you want to present yourself. Practice at home on a short
                and pithy presentation. By being well-informed and prepared,
                you can match your skills and abilities against the
                company's.
                It is not only your education, specialization and elective
                courses that are important. Trust and overseas experience is
                often seen as an advantage. Your personality will determine
                whether you get the job or not. Think about yourself, who
                are you? What do you want? What do you know?</p>

            <h3>Make contact</h3>
            <p>
                The exhibitors at DatE-IT will most probably not give you
                a thesis project or a job immediately. If you make contact
                with the company representer, ask for a business card and
                inform that person that you would like to contact him or her
                again. Make sure to be remembered! You can give the company
                your own business card or your résumé. Keep track of which
                company that have received your résumé. Write down and
                document what has been said and how possible future contact
                will take place.</p>
            <p>
                If you choose to leave your résumé, remember that it is your
                way of marketing yourself. Make sure that the résumé clearly
                states who you are, what you know and also what your goals
                are. Be as thorough as possible when you write your résumé.
                It should be easy for the employer to understand your
                competense. If you contact different companies, you can give
                them different résumés which are tailor-made to each
                company.</p>

            <h3>Submit your résumé</h3>
            <p>
                During the fair it is possible to attend interviews with a
                number of companies. To take advantage of this opportunity,
                you must submit your résumé. Résumé submission will open
                as the fair approaches.

            <h3>Become a company host</h3>
            <p>As a company host you will get a great opportunity to
                better get to know the company you are assigned to. During
                the evening you will get the chance to mingle and eat dinner
                with all the attending companies and other students.</p>
            <p>
                As a company host you will get: breakfast, lunch, a ticket
                to the banquet, and a DatE-IT T-shirt which you will wear
                during the day. Snacks will be available the whole day
                during the fair.
